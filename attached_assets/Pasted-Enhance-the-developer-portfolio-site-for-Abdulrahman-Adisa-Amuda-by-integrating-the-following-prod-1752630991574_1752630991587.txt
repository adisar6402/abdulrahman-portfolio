Enhance the developer portfolio site for "Abdulrahman Adisa Amuda" by integrating the following production-ready features and fixes. This builds on the existing site already created.

📌 FIX FIRST:
- Fix the broken blog system. Right now, blog posts don’t open correctly when clicked.
- Use either dynamic routing (`/blog/[slug]`) or integrate a Notion-based blog CMS.
- If using markdown, use `gray-matter` and `remark` to render the post pages with full styling and responsiveness.
- If using Notion, connect a public Notion database to fetch blog entries dynamically using the Notion API and render them using `react-notion-x` or similar.

✅ ADD THESE SMART FEATURES TO THE SITE:

1. ✅ **Real-Time Visitor Count**
- Add a visitor counter on the homepage or footer
- Use a lightweight approach: Vercel Analytics, Plausible, or Supabase if available
- Example: “👁️ 253 visitors this week”

2. ✅ **GitHub Star Count Badges**
- For each displayed project, use the GitHub API to show:
  - Star count (⭐ 48 stars)
  - Last updated date (🕒 3 days ago)
- These should be pulled dynamically from the user's GitHub profile: https://github.com/adisar6402

3. ✅ **Newsletter Signup Integration**
- Add a newsletter signup form
- Integrate with either:
  - **Substack** (via iframe or link to newsletter)
  - **Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)** via embedded form or REST API
- Place it in the footer or a dedicated "Subscribe" section

4. ✅ **Floating WhatsApp & Telegram Contact Button**
- Add floating action buttons (FABs) on bottom right
- WhatsApp: Link to `https://wa.me/<phone_number>`
- Telegram: Link to `https://t.me/<username>`
- Use recognizable icons, hover tooltips, and mobile-friendly styles

5. ✅ **“Recently Updated Projects” Feed**
- Use GitHub API to pull the 3–5 most recently updated repos from https://github.com/adisar6402
- Display them in a sidebar or a homepage section
- Include project title, short description, and how recently it was updated (e.g., “Updated 4 days ago”)

🧠 UX Tips:
- Make sure all features are mobile responsive
- Ensure animations still load smoothly
- Add hover states for project cards, blog links, and buttons
- Stick to current design language (dark/light mode, spacing, Tailwind classes)

✅ Keep the code modular and clean. Stop only if system limitations are reached — otherwise implement all features above directly into the site.

This is an elite-level personal portfolio — make it look and feel like a startup product dashboard.
